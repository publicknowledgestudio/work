# PK Work

Task management and scrum automation for [Public Knowledge Studio](https://publicknowledge.co). A real-time web app built with Vite + vanilla JS on top of Firebase (Firestore, Cloud Functions, Hosting), with Slack integrations for daily standups and an AI studio manager.

**Live app:** [work.publicknowledge.co](https://work.publicknowledge.co)

## What it does

PK Work is a lightweight, opinionated project tracker tailored for a small design studio. It covers the full daily workflow: planning what to work on, tracking time, running standups, managing clients and billing, and keeping a people directory.

### Views

| View | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **My Day** | Personal daily planner with a draggable time-grid calendar (9am-7pm, 15-min slots), Google Calendar overlay, up-next queue, and tomorrow planning |
| **My Tasks** | Vertical list of all tasks assigned to you, grouped by status |
| **Backlog** | Kanban board with 5 status columns (Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Review, Done) |
| **Team** | Kanban grouped by team member; drag cards between people to reassign |
| **Clients** | Kanban grouped by client |
| **Projects** | Kanban grouped by project |
| **Standup** | Scrum agenda: recently completed, in-progress by person, and items needing attention (overdue, stuck, unassigned) |
| **Timesheets** | Generate monthly time reports per client from tracked time blocks, with per-project hourly rates and a printable table |
| **Manage** | CRUD for clients (name, logo, default hourly rate, currency) and projects (name, client link, hourly rate, wiki page) |
| **People** | Directory of internal team and external contacts with profiles and wiki pages |

### Key features

- **Real-time sync** -- all changes propagate instantly via Firestore listeners; no manual refresh
- **Drag and drop** -- reassign tasks across statuses, people, clients, and projects; drag tasks onto the time grid to schedule them
- **Time blocking** -- schedule focus tasks on a visual 15-minute-slot day calendar; blocks persist to Firestore for timesheet generation
- **Google Calendar integration** -- OAuth-based overlay of today's calendar events alongside your time blocks
- **Inline task creation** -- type a task title with `@mentions` in any column footer and press Enter
- **Context menu** -- right-click any task card for quick status, assignee, priority changes, or to add to My Day
- **Status cycling** -- click a task's status icon to advance it through the workflow, with an undo toast
- **Timesheets** -- select a client and month; the app queries all team members' dailyFocus documents, cross-references tasks, and generates an itemised table with hours and amounts (using per-project hourly rates)
- **Standup board** -- structured scrum view with discussion tracking, progress bar, inline notes, and attention flags for overdue or stuck work
- **People directory** -- internal team + external contacts; each person has an editable profile and a markdown wiki page
- **Project wiki pages** -- each project has a Page tab with markdown content, tracked by editor and timestamp
- **@mentions** -- mention people and projects while creating tasks; mentions are rendered as clickable tags
- **Markdown rendering** -- wiki pages support basic markdown (headings, bold, italic, links, lists, code blocks)

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Firebase CLI (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)
- A Firebase project with Firestore, Hosting, Cloud Functions, and Storage enabled
- A Google Cloud project with the Calendar API enabled (for calendar integration)

### Install and run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # Start local dev server (port 3000)
```

### Deploy

```bash
npm run deploy       # Build + deploy everything (hosting + functions + rules + indexes)

# Or deploy individually:
firebase deploy --only hosting
firebase deploy --only functions
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

### Firebase secrets

Two secrets are required for Cloud Functions:

```bash
firebase functions:secrets:set CLAUDE_API_KEY      # API key for REST endpoint auth
firebase functions:secrets:set SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL   # Scrumpy incoming webhook URL
```

## API

All endpoints require an `x-api-key` header matching `CLAUDE_API_KEY`.

**Base URL:** `https://us-central1-workdotpk-a06dc.cloudfunctions.net/api`

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/tasks` | List tasks. Filters: `?assignee=`, `?status=`, `?clientId=`, `?projectId=` |
| POST | `/tasks` | Create task. Accepts `assignees[]` or `assignee` (string, backward compat) |
| PATCH | `/tasks/:id` | Update task. Setting `status: "done"` auto-sets `closedAt` |
| DELETE | `/tasks/:id` | Delete task |
| GET | `/scrum` | Daily scrum summary: closed yesterday + open items per person |
| POST | `/standups` | Submit standup (yesterday, today, blockers) |
| GET | `/standups` | List recent standups (limit 20). Filter: `?userEmail=` |
| GET | `/clients` | List all clients |
| GET | `/projects` | List all projects |
| GET | `/people` | List people. Filters: `?type=`, `?clientId=` |
| POST | `/people` | Create person |
| PATCH | `/people/:id` | Update person |
| DELETE | `/people/:id` | Delete person |
| GET | `/people/:id/content` | Get person wiki page |
| PATCH | `/people/:id/content` | Update person wiki page |
| GET | `/projects/:id/content` | Get project wiki page |
| PATCH | `/projects/:id/content` | Update project wiki page |
| POST | `/notes` | Save meeting notes |

## Data model

### Task statuses

`backlog` → `todo` → `in_progress` → `review` → `done`

### Task priorities

`low` | `medium` | `high` | `urgent`

### Billing

- Each **client** has a `defaultHourlyRate` and `currency` (INR or USD)
- Each **project** has its own `hourlyRate` and `currency`, inherited from its client on creation
- **Timesheets** compute per-task amounts using the project's rate (falling back to the client's default)

### Daily Focus

Each user's daily plan is stored in `dailyFocus/{email}_{YYYY-MM-DD}`:

- `taskIds[]` -- ordered list of focus tasks for the day
- `timeBlocks[]` -- array of `{ taskId, start: "HH:mm", end: "HH:mm" }` for scheduled blocks

These persist across sessions and are the source data for timesheet generation.

## Authentication

- Google Sign-In restricted to `@publicknowledge.co` accounts
- Firestore rules enforce domain-level access on all collections
- Users can only edit their own daily focus and profile
- The REST API uses a shared API key (for Asty / external integrations)

## Slack integrations

### Scrumpy

An incoming webhook bot that posts formatted daily scrum summaries to `#daily-scrum`. Triggered via the Cloud Functions webhook endpoint.

### Asty (OpenClaw)

An always-on AI studio manager that runs as an OpenClaw gateway. It connects to Slack via socket mode and has 9 tools wrapping the PK Work REST API:

- `pkwork_list_tasks`, `pkwork_create_task`, `pkwork_update_task`, `pkwork_delete_task`
- `pkwork_scrum_summary`, `pkwork_submit_standup`, `pkwork_list_standups`
- `pkwork_list_clients`, `pkwork_list_projects`

Scheduled routines include daily briefings, scrum reminders, stale task detection, weekly recaps, and reference link archiving. See `CLAUDE.md` for full details.
